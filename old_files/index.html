 vertical excitation energies of 13 BODIPY based dye sensitizers are benchmarked by means of TD-DFT,
using 36 functionals from different DFT rungs. Most TD-DFT results were found to overestimate the
excitation energies, and show mean absolute error (MAE) values in the range 0.2–0.5 eV. The dispersioncorrected,
spin-component-scaled, double-hybrid (DSD) functionals DSD-BLYP and DSD-PBEP86 were
found to have the smallest MAE values of 0.083 eV and 0.106 eV, respectively, which is close to the
range of average errors found in the more expensive coupled-cluster methods. Moreover, DSD-BLYP
and DSD-PBEP86 functionals show excellent consistency and quality of results (standard deviation ¼
0.048 eV and 0.069 eV respectively). However, the range separated hybrid (RSH) and the range
separated double hybrid (RSDH) functionals were found to provide the best predictability (linear
determination coefficient R2 > 0.97 eV).</P> </hr>

    The current environmental and energy dilemma has promoted
substantial research and efforts in renewable resources of
energy. Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) photovoltaic systems
are among the leading technologies in renewable energy and
are therefore extensively explored.1–15 Boron dipyrromethene
(BODIPY) chromophores are very promising in this regard,
since they present sharp and intense absorption and emission
spectra and excellent chemical and photochemical stabilities.
16–18 Moreover, the optical properties of BODIPYs can be
tuned by chemical modications through a multitude of
substitutions.19–23 Due to these remarkable optical and chemical
properties, BODIPYs are widely used as light harvesting moieties
in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC),24–31 heterojunction
organic solar cells,32–34 and perovskite solar cells.35 In addition,
BODIPY chromophores are also used in other diverse applications
ranging from optoelectronics and OLEDs36,37 to
bioimaging.
